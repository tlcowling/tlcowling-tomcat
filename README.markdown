##Overview

Installs a Tomcat Webserver.  You can use it if you want...

##Module Description

 "What does this module *do*?"
   Installs, configures and manages Apache Tomcat

 "Why would I use it?"
   Well quite frankly I don't care if you use it or not, I have not egotistical requirements for your usage.

##Setup

###What tomcat affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form. 

###Setup Requirements

  Currently can be used with hiera or without, so long as variables are passed in correctly.

###Beginning with tomcat

  include tomcat

##Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here. 

##Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module. This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

##Limitations

Currently only tested with Ubuntu

##Development
